### Install

Easier way:

```
$ pip install listconfig
```

To use the bleeding edge version:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/puhitaku/listconfig.git
$ cd listconfig
$ pip install -e .
```


### Usage

Specify a `.config` file in somewhere like Linux Kernel.
Formatted list is output from stdout. Redirect it at which you like to put.

```
$ listconfig /path/to/Kconfig /path/to/.config > out
```

The `ARCH` is automatically detected from `.config`.
Specify `--arch` option to change it manually.

```
$ listconfig --arch=arm /path/to/Kconfig /path/to/.config > out
```

The description is generated from the "help" section of Kconfig items.
Specify `--help-lines` or `-l` to change how many lines to pick.

```
$ listconfig --help-lines=1 /path/to/Kconfig /path/to/.config
